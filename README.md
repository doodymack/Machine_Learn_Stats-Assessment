# H Dip in Data Analytics 2021-2022
# Machine Learning & Statistics
## Winter Semester Assessment- Paul Mc Grath
***
<br>

This repository contains jupyter notebooks and other relevant files used to demonstrate my work on:
- ``Machine Learning``
- ``Statistics``
<br>

 for my module: 
 Machine Learning & Statistics

---
---

The repository contains three folders:
- images
- Exercises
- Time Series Anomaly Detection

Images Folder:
- contains any images used in the Notebooks

Exercises Folder:
- contains the completed course topic exercises in notebook form

Time Series Anomaly Detection Folder:
- contains the Notebook containing the Keras Assignment (Time Series Anomaly Detection)

<br>

## Setup

Steps to install
---
<br>

The work is based on **Python 3** code and executed via a **Jupyter Notebook** <br>
Jupyter allows the creation of a Notebook that contains summary text and image files while also allowing the running of of Python code. <br><br>
The key files to run in the repository are:  

Exercises Folder:  
**01-statistics_exercises 1&2.ipynb**  
**01-statistics_exercise_3.ipynb**  
**02-models_exercises.ipynb**   
**03-parameters_exercises.ipynb**  

TimeSeriesAnomalyDetection-Keras Folder:  
**Time Series Anomaly Detection.ipynb**  
<br>

To execute the work you should have **Python 3**  and  **Jupyter** notebooks installed. <br><br>


### How to install the necessary packages:
While Jupyter runs code in many programming languages, Python is a requirement (Python 3.3 or greater, or Python 2.7) for installing the Jupyter Notebook.  
It is recommended to use the Anaconda distribution to install **Python** and 
**Jupyter**. <br>
Anaconda conveniently installs Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science.

***Note the packages and dependencies are in my 'My requirements.txt' file*** <br> <br>

### Installation instructions:

- [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) <br>
 Its recommended to download Anacondaâ€™s latest Python 3 version (currently Python 3.5).
- Install the version of Anaconda which you downloaded, following the instructions on the download page.
This should also have installed Jupyter Notebook. <br>

<br>

## Running the notebook in Github:

Note: 
- The notebook is created to automatically run all code if executed within the GitHub 
- should the code not run, close the file and re-open <br><br>

---

## Running the notebook on your local PC environment:

After installing **Python** and **Jupyter** packages via **Anaconda**:


How to run the ipynb files:

- The key file is ipynb file.
- Once this is opened Jupyter starts off in web browser but is running on your machine
- Once opened click on the 'kernel' dropdown button on the taskbar at the top of the screen
- click on 'restart kernel and run all cells'
- Thus recreates the text and re-runs the code in each program cells from the beginning
- read the notebook from top to bottom
- read the text above each program cell for background as to the purpose of the python code 
- within each code are additional commments on the specific code  as non-executable commented out brief explanation  
i.e. ***#asterisk followed by green text***

#### In summary once the required code is downloaded:
1. Download the required packages
2. open the ipynb file: 
3. restart the notebook
4. read the notebook from top to bottom

Troubleshooting:
- The code has been checked to ensure it runs end to end
- However if you get a warning then restart the kernel again as per above <br>

## Summary: 
 The modue comprises of two parts  
 1. A grounding in statistical ideas and techniques used within Data Analytics.  
 2. An introduction to the area of neural networks and Machine Learning and how it can be applied to solve a real-world issue.

 The notebooks in this repository should act as an introductory guide to the topics.  

 The exercises and project has allowed me to develop my skills in statistics and machine learning to give me a grounding in the topics that should facilitate further exploation of these topics.<br>

<br>

## Conclusion:

The project allowed me to improve my working knowledge of statistics that would be applied in a Data Analytics spehere and the basics of Machine Learning including the use of Keras-Tensorflow package. <br>  The course has given me an introduction to these topics and a curiosity to explore other online packages  and to apply what I have learned and improve my knowledge further.  
I intend to update the repository as my knowledge in the areas grows.<br><br>

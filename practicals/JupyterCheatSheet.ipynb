    "Interactive notebooks are experiencing a rise in popularity. Why?\n",
    "Simply because it’s a great teaching environment, powerful, shareable, and provides the ability to perform data visualization in the same environment. Which interactive notebooks should I use? I recommend:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.\n",
    "Colaboratory is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud.\n",
    "Both of them support\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown which is a markup language that is a superset of HTML.\n",
    "Latex to render mathematical and scientific writing.\n",
    "Markdown\n",
    "It’s a very simple language that allows you to write HTML in a shortened way. It can be used on some websites like Stack Overflow or to write documentations (essentially on GitHub).\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown file extension is .md\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write in Markdown, you use shortened notations which are replaced by the corresponding HTML tags. Each time, I will tell you the HTML equivalent of the Markdown notation to show you how Markdown made our life easier than ever.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even web developers, now, use Markdown then convert it to HTML using some websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Headings\n",
    "You make titles using hashtags #. A single hashtag gives you a title (h1), two hashtags give you a subtitle (h2) and so on as shown below:\n",
